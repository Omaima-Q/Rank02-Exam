So finally i passed rank 2 exam 🎉

I tried the exam more than 10 times, it feels relieved to pass this exam and i feel great can't explain my feeling 😭.

So just let me tell you what questions i got in the last try before i forgot them 😅 :

1- ft_strcpy : which is very simple question and easy to solve.

2- inter : i got this question in more than 5 times during my tries, so i advice to focus on this question.

3- paramsum : very easy question as well, but stuck little bit on it. But passed 👍🏻.

4- sort_int_tab : also easy question, but i pushed it too many times and didn't pass. I pushed it at the end i already lose hope to pass but guess what it passed also 🙀😭.

Last advice : don't underestimate any question whatever is the question focus and make sure you get the same outputs as the examples given in the subject.
I updated the question that passed in the exam. The questions with " passed in the exam " are correct and you can practice it and see the way of solving it.

Good Luck 🎉
